[Project 1 : Bank-churn-prediction-app ](https://github.com/ElvisKoech/bank-churn-prediction-app)
+ Customer churn (or customer attrition) is a tendency of customers to abandon a brand and stop being a paying client of a particular business.
+ I used a supervised machine learning classification approach to solve this problem and based on the number of target classes I built a binary classifier type of Machine learning model.
+ Data Source: Github Columns: 14 Rows: 10000
+ Using LogisticRegression ML Estimator, a bank can measure the likelihood of customer churn with an accuracy score of 0.813(81.3%)

[Project 2: Text Analysis App](https://github.com/ElvisKoech/Text-analysis-app)
+ Companies deal with huge amounts of data every day, from emails, chats, and social media posts, to customer support tickets, and survey responses. However, 80% of this data is unstructured and, therefore, hard to process â€“ not to mention time-consuming if done manually.
+ Text analysis app can be used to visualize the unstructured data
* [Text-analysis-streamlit-app](https://text-analysis-streamlit-app.herokuapp.com/)
+ Development Dependencies: 
   * Python
   * Streamlit 
   * Natural Language ToolKit
+ Unstructured data can deliver countless insights that help you make informed, data-driven decisions that can improve the customer experience
